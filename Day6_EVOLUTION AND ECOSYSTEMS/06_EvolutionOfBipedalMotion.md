## Evolution of bipedal motion (walking) 

__This video shows how evolutionary algorithms can allow the computer to discover things that they were not directly programmed to do (please note the video is silent).__

In the video a bipedal (two-legged) creature can be seen. The movement of the creature’s joints are controlled by a simple network of simulated ‘neurones’. At the beginning, the connection and behaviour of the network is randomly initialised. You can see from the video that this is not a very successful strategy, the creature just lifts it’s legs aimlessly in the air and falls over.

Many copies or ‘offspring’ of this original, randomly initialised creature are then made. Each copy is slightly different due to small random changes to the network’s connections and neurone responses. Each offspring is tested individually. The creatures that are able to move the furthest distance from the green circle in the middle become the ‘parents’ for the next generation. Initially, none of the offspring do very well, but there will be some variation in ability due to the random mutations in each network, so some will be ever so slightly better ‘walkers’ than others.

This process is repeated over and over in a loop. Over time, each generation gets slightly better than the previous one. The video shows the best, or ‘fittest’ individual every five generations.

After only 20 generations the creature walks competently in a straight line. The researchers who wrote the software did not know how to configure the network that controls the creature’s walking so it would walk like this. The software itself ‘learned’ how to configure the network so that the creature could walk. A new behaviour evolved that was not present in the program when it began running.

Do you think the video shows how evolutionary algorithms can be used to break ‘Descartes dictum’ and create systems that exceed the knowledge of their designers?
