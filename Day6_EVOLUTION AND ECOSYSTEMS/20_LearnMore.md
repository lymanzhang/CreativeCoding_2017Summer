## Learning more

Now that you’ve completed the course, you’re probably keen to learn more and improve your creative coding knowledge and skills even further.

This introductory course has only scratched the surface of what draws from a rich and complex collection of fields (programming and computer science, mathematics, philosophy, biology, artificial intelligence, creativity, fine art, design, music, architecture, fashion, etc.).

You will find many interesting web sites that can help you learn more about creative coding and generative art. Obviously the [Processing website](http://www.processing.org/) is the best place to learn more about Processing.

If you want to dive deeper into programming with Processing and learn more about Generative Art and Creative Coding, you may find the following books useful.

- Casey Reas and Ben Fry, [Getting Started with Processing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144937980X/?tag=futur05-21), O’Reilly Media, 2010

- Hartmut Bohnacker et.al, [Generative Design : Visualize, Program, and Create with Processing](http://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-Processing/dp/1616890770/?tag=futur05-21), Princeton Architectural Press, New York, 2012

- Casey Reas and Ben Fry, Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists, Second Edition, MIT Press, Boston, Mass., 2007

In addition to the many people and websites we have mentioned throughout the course, you may find these sites interesting:

- The [Creators Project](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/) regularly features code and technology-based artistic projects;
- [Creative Applications Network](http://www.creativeapplications.net/) regularly blogs about creative coding projects from North America and Europe;
- For many years the artist [Paul Prudence](http://www.paulprudence.com/) has run the [Data is Nature](http://www.dataisnature.com/) blog on ‘Interrelationships between natural processes, computational systems and procedural-based art practices’;
- The [eu-gene](http://lurk.org/groups/eu-gene/) mailing list discusses generative art and creative coding;
- [Generative Art](http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/generative-art-links/) Links on Syntopia.

If you want to learn more about programming on FutureLearn, the [Begin Programming](http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/begin-programming/) course covers how to program in Java for mobile applications.
