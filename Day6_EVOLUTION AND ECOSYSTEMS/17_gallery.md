## Gallery for week 6 of Creative Coding

The weekly gallery showcases artwork created by learners participating in Creative Coding.

The gallery is curated by the lead-educators and moderators, and at the end of each week they’ll select a small number of pieces that have been shared by learners with the Monash Creative Coding group on Flickr that best reflects the week’s theme or topic in interesting ways. We hope the gallery inspires your own creative coding.

###Sharing your images on Flickr
If you’d like your artwork to be considered for the weekly gallery, you’ll need to post it to the [Monash Creative Coding](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2615752@N24/) group on Flickr. If you haven’t already, you’ll need to register with Flickr. If you’re not sure how to do this, review [Signing in to Flickr](https://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/social-media-tips/#flickrsignin) and [How to join a Flickr group](https://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/social-media-tips/#flickrgroup).

If you are uploading your artwork to the Monash Creative coding group on Flickr and would like it to be considered for the weekly gallery, please specify the image viewing permissions to 'Public'.
