## Guidelines for effective feedback

In this course we are asking you to submit an assignment, then to give feedback on the assignment submitted by another learner.

Here are some guidelines on how you can give other learners effective feedback on their work:

_ Make sure that the tone of your feedback is always constructive. There is no place in this review process for feedback that is negative, disrespectful or derogatory.

_ Make sure that your feedback addresses the assignment brief. If you are making suggestions, make sure they are clear and align with one of the specifications of the brief. Emphasise the positives of what the other learner submitted. Identify the things they did well.

_ Remember the context of this course: learning how to program through the authoring of your own creative programs. The purpose of this assignment is to encourage you to think about what it could mean for you to create, then become emotionally attached to an artificial life using approaches from creative coding and computer science. Therefore, please make sure your comments and suggestions are appropriate for this task.

Remember, constructive feedback, and the process of reflecting on the feedback you receive on your own assignment, are both very powerful learning opportunities, and we hope that you give and receive feedback in the spirit of creating a supportive learning environment.
