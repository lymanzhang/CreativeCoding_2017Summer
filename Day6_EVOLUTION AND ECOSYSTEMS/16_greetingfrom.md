## Greetings from... 

_Now it’s time to put your coding skills to the test. The final coding challenge for this course is to create your own ‘generative postcard’._

Using Processing, create a sketch that uses any of the elements we’ve been discussing throughout the course: graphic shapes, images, text and sound. You don’t have to use all these elements, indeed you may find that limiting the type of elements helps to create a more focused creative idea.

Your postcard should respond to the the theme of ‘place’. Traditionally, postcards were sent to friends and family when the sender was far away. They also served as a memento of a place and time, often fondly remembered. Even in today’s always-connected Internet age, people still send stylised photos of places they are visiting via social media networks.

You can interpret the sense of place in many different ways: where you are right now, where you live, where you grew up, a favourite place of the imagination, a place made from and about code…it’s up to you.

If you can, design your postcard so that each time it’s run, the results are different in some way. For example you could use the time of day, your location, or some careful use of random numbers to allow this. You might like to think how the work will carry your ‘signature’ – having a recognisable style or aesthetic – so don’t use too much randomness.

If you like, you can also make your postcard interactive, responding to mouse or keyboard events. Keep the interaction simple and intuitive, ideally it shouldn’t be necessary to have any explanation of how to interact with your work.

### Share your image with other learners

Once you’ve developed your sketch, save an image and then post it to the [Monash Creative Coding Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2615752@N24/) or [another image sharing site of your choice](https://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/social-media-tips/#images) and then enter the URL for your image in the comments section so others can enjoy your creation.
