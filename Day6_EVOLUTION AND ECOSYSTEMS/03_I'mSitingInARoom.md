## I am sitting in a room


This audio recording is of Alvin Lucier’s ‘I am sitting in a room’ (1969). The work uses feedback to extraordinary effect.

The work was made by Lucier recording the sound of his own voice onto tape, playing it back into a room through a speaker, and recording this new version played back into the room. The new recording is then once again played back into the room, re-recorded, and so on. We hear a total of 32 repetitions. The feedback process slowly transforms the sound of Lucier’s voice into the resonant frequencies of the room, eventually becoming unrecognisable as speech, instead we hear ‘a curiously tonal melodic fragment’.

Through this feedback process, the original text transcends its original form becoming ‘music’ according to the acoustic properties of the space. As Nicolas Collins observes in the notes that accompany this recording:

__Alvin Lucier was probably the first composer to realise that the architectural space could be more than a supportive setting for musical instruments, that it could be an instrument in itself.__

Note: we have included the full recording here which runs for approximately 45 mins. You will get the best understanding of this composition by listening to the complete work in a quiet, comfortable listening environment. If you do not have enough time to listen to the full recording, listen at several different points in the recording to get a sense of how feedback is being used so effectively in this composition.
