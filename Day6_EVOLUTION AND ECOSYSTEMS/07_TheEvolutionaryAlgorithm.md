## The evolutionary algorithm

__Many different variations of the evolutionary algorithm have been developed for computing, but the basic principle is straightforward.__

The Darwinian process of evolution by natural selection can be summarised by three conditions:

- A population of individuals that can make copies of themselves exists;
- The copying process is imperfect, leading to variation;
- Variation in the copying process leads to differences in the ability of offspring to survive and copy themselves.

It remains quite mind-boggling how such a simple set of conditions outlines how all life on Earth evolved – what the psychologist William James called ‘the strangest intellectual stopping-place ever proposed by one man to another.’

The beauty of this process is that it can be expressed as an algorithm and so is not limited to biological life. The basic algorithm can be used to evolve almost anything that can be represented appropriately on a computer.

To use this algorithm on a computer, we need a ‘population’ of individuals that we want to evolve. Individuals are usually generated from a digital genome that controls the form, behaviour, or function of an individual.

Here’s the basic evolutionary algorithm as shown in the diagram above:
```java
Initialise the population with random individuals;
evaluate the fitness of each individual;
repeat until end conditions are satisfied {
    Select parents;
    Recombine pairs of parents;
    Mutate the resulting offspring;
    Evaluate fitness of new individuals;
    Select individuals to survive to the next generation;
}
```
‘End conditions’ normally means that you’ve found a solution to your problem, or that you’ve used up enough computer time. The selection of parents is usually determined by their fitness (explained below), often on a probabilistic basis, so fitter individuals are more likely to have more offspring, but less fit individuals still have a chance too.

__Fitness__
One of the key things about this algorithm is how we evaluate the fitness of each individual. In the video example from the previous step, fitness was measured by the distance the creature was able to move outside the green circle. The greater the distance, the better (or higher) the fitness.

In the case of Richard Dawkins’ biomorphs, fitness was assigned by the person using the system, based on how ‘interesting’ or ‘biomorphic’ each individual appeared (one ‘generation’ – around 16-25 individuals are presented simultaneously on screen for the user to compare and select the fittest). The user (Dawkins) selected the parents for each generation based on appearance, so the algorithm was more like selective breeding than evolution by natural selection.

So fitness must be either calculated by the computer, or assigned by the user of the system. This second method, known as artificial evolution, aesthetic selection or the Interactive Genetic Algorithm puts a human in the ‘evolutionary loop’. This has advantages and disadvantages:

- People are good at judging the ‘aesthetics’ of what they’re trying to evolve, whereas computers are not.

- People are slow at evaluating fitness compared with the computer. They also get tired quickly of looking at hundreds or thousands of individual images and trying to compare them.

For artistic applications, the disadvantages tend to outweigh the advantages, which is one of the reasons why this method of using evolution hasn’t ever really become widespread.

Somewhat obviously, for fitness to be calculated by the computer we need to have a computable way to do the calculation. Something like the distance from a starting point is easy if we want to evolve things that move, such as in the previous video example. But what if we want interesting art or design?

Despite more than 100 years of trying to devise a formula or algorithm of ‘aesthetics’ for example, this remains a challenging research problem.

However, there are other ways. The term ‘fitness’ reminds us of the evolutionary cliche: survival of the fittest, but nature is not an ongoing battle for one single, fittest survivor. In biology many different complex relationships exist between organisms beyond competition: cooperation, symbiosis, parasitism, codependence. These relationships, and the relationships between organisms and their environment also present many exciting opportunities for developing generative art.
