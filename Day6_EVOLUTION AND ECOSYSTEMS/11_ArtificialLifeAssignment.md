## Artificial life assignment

It’s time to write a short piece that can be read and commented upon by another learner taking the course. You will then be asked to read and comment on someone else’s work.

In fewer than 500 words, please explain your thoughts on the following:

Our attitudes about what constitutes life changes from culture to culture. Indeed our attitudes about life changes from person to person! Consider for a minute people who own pets. Some people are emotionally predisposed to cats, some to dogs or horses or birds or a combination of these creatures. Notwithstanding how emotionally attached we become to our pets, pets don’t live in the wild; all pets live in human environments. In other words pets have artificial lives.

With this in mind, would there be anything wrong with creating, then becoming emotionally attached to, an artificial life using approaches from creative coding and computer science? Would you nurture an artificial pet? Would you love and care for it? If you had a friend that was emotionally attached to an artificial pet would you let it ‘die’ even if you had the option to keep it ‘alive’?
