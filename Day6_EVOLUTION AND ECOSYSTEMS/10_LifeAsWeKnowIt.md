## Life as we know it

__‘Artificial life’ is a term first used by the computer scientist Chris Langton in 1986 to describe human-made systems that exhibit behaviours characteristic in biological systems, such as morphogenetic development, metabolism and adaptation. The domain is concerned with generating lifelike behaviour using computer simulations or by building robots.__

For Langton the point of difference from the other sciences is to wed life to the property of form and not matter. In other words artificial life describes a specific area of research investigating the principles that constitute a living system independently from the materials that constitute it. Whilst this might seem harmless enough, the underlying principle attempts to redefine the single, carbon-based instance of ‘life-as-we-know-it’ to the more general phenomena of ‘life-as-it-could-be’, where ‘life’ is defined by mechanisms and behaviours that might be realised in other media, such as silicon.

A key feature of artificial life is the idea of emergence—where new patterns or behaviours emerge or evolve from computational processes that could not be predicted by the author of the computer code. We have already [encountered this concept in week 2](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding/4/steps/150688) of the course.

The author Katherine Hayles explains in [How We Became Posthuman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Became-Posthuman-Cybernetics-Informatics-ebook/dp/B0026REAF6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401118372&sr=8-1&keywords=how+we+became+posthuman&tag=futur05-21) that the idea of emergence is to begin with a few simple local rules and then, through local interaction and feedback, allow complexity to emerge spontaneously… as this ‘recursive looping’ continues, small deviations can quickly become magnified, leading to the complex interactions and unpredictable evolutions associated with emergence. For [Mitchell Whitelaw](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Metacreation-Artificial-Life-Mitchell-Whitelaw/dp/0262731762/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401118471&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=metacration&tag=futur05-21) emergence is central to artificial life. It is the concept that explains the crucial leap it makes between non-life and life.

The concept of [emergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) is in fact, quite old, and has had different interpretations and meanings at different times. Its power as an ‘explanatory’ mechanism rises and falls in parallel with different developments in the sciences, what the philosopher Thomas Khun called ‘[paradigm shifts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)’. In some interpretations, emergence reminds us of our ignorance, being used as a label for phenomena that are too complex for us to comprehend directly, or in the case of ‘strong’ emergence, even to simulate on a computer.

For some people the idea that we can create silicon-based life might seem fanciful or even profoundly immoral. However, humans have always redefined what life is and what life could be. The idea of slavery is based on the assumption that slaves are lesser humans than non-slaves. Indeed the philosopher Aristotle believed the souls of slaves were incomplete and that slaves were, like domestic animals, tools to be used.

Our assumptions about life have always been in flux. Humans always redefine their standards to adapt to new situations. As western cultures transformed from agrarian societies to industrial ones in the last 200 years our relationships with animals has undergone a radical rethink. Most of us no longer think of animals as livestock but think of them as pets with personalities.

Even some of the scientists who work in this area have their concerns about this promethean quest to ‘create life’. They are not worried about advanced humanoid robots taking over the world, as is often portrayed in science fiction films such as the ‘Terminator’. Rather their concern is for small, human engineered ‘organisms’ that have the ability to rapidly evolve and adapt, quickly reproducing and evading human control, much like a viral epidemic or bacterial plague.

Such creatures, if they were to be made, could be built at a molecular scale using developments in nanotechnology for example (such a scenario was portrayed in the science fiction novel [Prey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(novel)) by Michael Crichton). The principle – emergence – that so fascinates scientists and artists who work in this area, is also the reason why they are concerned, because in an open-ended system, complex behaviours emerge from lower level interactions and these behaviours cannot necessarily be predicted in advance or controlled.

### What do you think about artificial life?

Is it unreasonable to believe that we can create an artificial life using approaches from creative coding and computer science?

What is the difference between the simulation and the realisation of a phenomena? Computer games often simulate human violence and death for example, but we appreciate that the violence or death isn’t real. How ‘good’ would a computer simulation of a living being have to be before we would be convinced it was alive?

Simulacra and chimeras are popular ideas in writing and culture throughout history, why are we so fascinated with these topics?
