## Day6_EVOLUTION AND ECOSYSTEMS

Introduction to Week 6  View 11 comments
Watch Jon introduce week 6 and provide an overview of the themes to be covered in the final week of the course.

If you have completed the previous five weeks of the course, congratulations on making it this far!

The format this week is different from previous weeks. Our focus will be on some selected ideas that drive creative coding and generative art. Many of these ideas come from other disciplines, such as the Biological sciences, or prior artistic practices.

We also want you to develop a final sketch for this course, a ‘generative postcard’ and share it with other learners doing the course.

Learning outcomes for week 6
At the end of this week you should be able to:

- Appreciate some of the basic ideas behind processes used in generative art, such as feedback, aesthetic selection and evolution;
- Describe and explore art and design made using evolutionary algorithms;
- Articulate your ideas and thoughts on some broader cultural issues concerning artificial life.
