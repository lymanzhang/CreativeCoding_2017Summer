## William Latham documentary

__One of the first artists to make use of evolution in the computer was William Latham. This documentary provides some insight into Latham’s creative process and how he though about using computers at the time (the documentary was made in 1990 - over a quarter of a century ago).__

In the documentary, Latham discusses many influences and ideas that informed the aesthetic of his work. His work – and indeed the work of many artists who use artificial evolution – has a distinctive aesthetic that is unique to the artist. This seems contrary to the idea that evolution proceeds without a ‘designer’ or guiding force. Use the comments for this page to discuss what the reasons for this contradiction might be.

Note that the full documentary runs for approximately 25 mins.
