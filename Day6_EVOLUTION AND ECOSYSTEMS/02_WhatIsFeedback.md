Feedback is a simple but powerful process that offers rich possibilities for constructing generative artworks.

The basic idea is quite straightforward and outlined in the diagram below. We begin with some object (for example a form, image or sound) that is fed into a system (S) and then undergoes a transformation or variation (T). Following that transformation, the results are fed back into the system and the process repeats. Over many iterations the original form changes, potentially lending to increasing complexity or interesting change. Offering some degree of control over T allows further variation to occur. Sometimes the control of T comes from the object or system itself, leading to self-directed feedback.

Schematic diagram of feedback

You have probably experienced a version of optical feedback if you’ve ever stood between two parallel mirrors. As you look into the mirrors you see ‘reflections of reflections of reflections…’ ad infinitum. In this case the system, S, is the mirrors in parallel and the transformation, T, is reflection.

When video arrived people quickly discovered that they could create interesting visual effects by simply pointing a live camera at a screen, the image feeding back into itself. Video artists [Woody and Steina Vasulka](http://vasulka.org/) were amongst the first to experiment with such processes as part of their creative practice.

The television series Dr. Who used video feedback to great effect in its opening titles (the first episode was broadcast in 1963).

In mathematics, the well-known [Mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) uses a form of feedback as part of its definition (zn+1=z2n+czn+1=zn2+c).

An elegant computational example can be found in the work [IMA Traveller](https://notnot.home.xs4all.nl/expandingimages/imatraveller/imatraveller.html) by the Dutch artists [Driessens and Verstappen](http://notnot.home.xs4all.nl/index.html) (shown above). The work begins with a single pixel at the centre of the screen (the ‘object’ of the feedback system). The pixel undergoes the transformation of division, being transformed into four new pixels with the colours of the new pixels based on those of the immediate environment (neighbouring pixels). This seemingly simple process generates an infinite universe of ever-renewing abstract textures.

The work also employs simple audience interaction, in that by using a mouse you can direct the pixel location that forms the centre of the feedback process. This allows you to explore parts of the texture that interest you, but this ‘interaction’ is cleverly limited. You cannot control the speed of feedback or stop the process, giving rise to the disturbing sensation that you are always ‘falling’ into a world without end, one that you cannot stop, revisit, or ever go back to. So the sense of control is illusory and the work evokes a sense of a the ‘computational sublime’.

This is how the artists describe the work:

__Ima traveller (1996) is interactive computer software for exploring an infinite universe. It enables you to make a journey into a space that is being created in real time. This space develops in the direction you are moving into, so there is no end to it. You travel forward in a smooth motion, you can drift in all directions, but you can never go back to where you came from. You are zooming in on a surface of infinite size, never reaching any boundaries.__
